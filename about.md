title: Hello! नमस्ते! Hej!

I am Ranveer. I write code for money, for intellectual stimulation and sometimes for the lulz. Every once in a while, [I pick up a book](https://www.goodreads.com/ranveeraggarwal) and then make it my life's mission to spread the word around and argue with people, equipped with newly learned ideas for several days following its completion.

I have recently turned into a fitness enthusiast after a 10 year long struggle with obesity, dropping ~35 Kgs in 1.5 years in a scalable manner (yes, you can contact me if you want to join the weight-droppers cult).

That's it. That's me right now.    

Well you've made it this far and you're still reading, so here are the more boring details.    
I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/). Here, I also minored with [IDC, IIT Bombay](http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/) in Industrial Design.    
I worked with Microsoft for four years. Fun times.    
Rest of the work-related stuff is up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ranveeraggarwal/).
