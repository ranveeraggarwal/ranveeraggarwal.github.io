# IITea

Early in the morning, or late in the night, itâ€™s undeniable that IIT Bombay runs on one fuel: tea. Our aim is to gather a comprehensive list of all the tea spots in the institute and present information about these visually, including location, timings, distance from various spots, and possibly even include price information and quality ratings. The guiding aim is to be able to provide most information to a person at a given location and time, in search for tea. In the process, we also aim to unearth parts of the institute with relatively lower availability, and hence potential hotspots for future stalls.

# Running
Create a basic server that can handle http requests and access the `index.html` in the root directory. If you have a Python console, this can be done by:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

on Python 2 or

    python3 -m http.server

on Python 3.
