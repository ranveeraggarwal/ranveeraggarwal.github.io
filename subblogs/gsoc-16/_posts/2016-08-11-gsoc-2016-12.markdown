### Moving the Panel

The panel that we began working on last week has finally been completed. Here are the major changes:

1. Every UI element now has a `set_center` function. This function does exactly what it says, it sets the center of the UI element to where we want.
2. We now store the relative positions of the elements within a panel. This is so that we can move the panel around and the elements can be re-allotted centers in accordance with the panel's new center.
3. Major changes in how sliders work. This is basically to facilitate the movement of individual slider elements when the slider as a whole is moved.

Using the above, we can now move the panel around.

### Aligning the Panel

Now, the panel can be left-aligned or right-aligned to the window. Left-alignment means that its position with respect to the left window boundary will remain constant. Similarly for right-alignment. This was done using the `set_center` in the above step and window modification events.

### What's next

GSoC ends in less than a couple of weeks. In this final sprint the following needs to be done:
 
* A file dialog needs to be built. For now, we'll be saving and opening files. 
* Refactoring for existing code.
* Making PRs into master.
