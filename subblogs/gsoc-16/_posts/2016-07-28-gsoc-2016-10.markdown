Last week, we began building an orbital menu. There is now some progress, with the basic elements working well with it.     
We now have text, a button and cubes working directly with the orbital menu which work very similar to the 2D GUI.
 
### Building the Menu
Using the ideas from Marc's example, the Assembly-Follower combination was integrated into our existing code. The assembly has the object, an orbit (a disk) and of course, the parts. We allotted these cubes, positions at 360/(number of parts) angles to the X-Axis. This is how it looks like:

We can also add other types of elements on the menu:

The possibilities are endless! :D

### ToDo

* Sliders currently don't work because sliding in 3D is a bit complex.
* There is a need to explore better methods to allot elements to the orbit.
