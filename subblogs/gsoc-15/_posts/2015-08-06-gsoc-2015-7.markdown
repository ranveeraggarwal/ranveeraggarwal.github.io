It’s been a while since my last post, but that doesn’t mean there hasn’t been any progress. So, last I was working with K3b to install codecs. Well, while after loads of issues, I finally got it to build and compile properly, but then, we noticed that K3b still uses Kdelibs4. So that means, Packagekit-Qt4 will have to be used. But since my machine wasn’t equiped with Packagekit-Qt4 or Kdelibs, I thought of moving over to an application that uses KF5.

## KCM Access
KCM Access has a nice screen reader tab wherein you can begin the on-screen narration. It has a checkbox which remains that way, even if the screen reader isn’t installed. So my task here was to add a button to install orca if it isn’t already and disable the checkbox in this case. Again, this button would install orca via PackageKit-Qt5 using the method similar to the one previously used.

It’s done and under review!

## Next Up
As soon as this is reviewed, I’ll go over to the next application, which as of now can be any of KCM Locale or K3b.
