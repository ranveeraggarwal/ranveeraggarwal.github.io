As of now, I am working on Dolphin and Samba and trying to get Samba installed through PackageKit-Qt instead of KPackageKit which it currently uses.

The biggest issue here is porting – the KDE Network Filesharing repository is currently not on KF5, which would make it impossible to work with PackageKit-Qt5, which is currently being used all across. So, a newbie porter, I’ve been working with Jonathan to port things properly and fix as many bugs as I encounter while doing so.

There might be additional bugfixes required with KIO or FileProperties, and they’ll be fixed as they come up.

Here are a few resources that I found extremely useful while porting
