And finally, package install on the first application stands done and dusted. It was a long journey – from building a mini application to porting to fixing several issues. But finally, things went well and Dolphin now successfully installs Samba using PackageKit-Qt.

## How to test it?
Install Dolphin from the master branch and KDE Network-Filesharing from frameworks. Now, right click anywhere, get to the share tab and bam! There it is.

K3b is the next application on the list. As of now, I have compilation issues, but as soon as I fix them, the implementation can proceed smoothly.
