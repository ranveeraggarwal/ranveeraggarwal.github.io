  "description": "We are designing a novel method to reconstruct human body using noisy point cloud data in real-time from a single Kinect. The method is currently being implemented in OpenFrameworks using OpenNI and NiTE. We'll be further investigating methods to render the reconstructed model in virtual reality, viewable on a head mounted display like Oculus."
