  "description": "Currently, if you have an OpenGL interface, you need to use Qt/GTK or some UI library to create a window and focus out of the OpenGL window to do simple UI tasks like fill forms, click on a button, save a file, etc. Our idea is to get rid of the external interfaces and have the UI built in. So, we built this cross platform minimal interface on top of VTK, which provides a very simple but powerful API, and can be tweaked to create futuristic interfaces."

  "description": "We designed and developed interfaces in Qt5 to install third party plugins, platform-independently across five KDE applications by querying for plugins using Appstream and then installing using PackageKit. Ported KDE applications and libraries like Network-Filesharing and language-plugins from KDELibs4 to KF5. Additionally fixed bugs where required, learnt software packaging and packaged PackageKit-Qt for launchpad."

  "image": "http://i.imgur.com/2OrPnX9.png"
  "description": "Initiated a project to future-proof legacy custodian applications by building a REST API controller. Built on NodeJS and Express, the controller is modular, re-programmable and uses ORM to connect to databases. Developed a prototype application using AngularJS and Materialize to prove that the controller works. Received a Pre-Placement Offer (PPO) for exceptional performance over the internship."
