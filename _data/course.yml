  "image": "http://i.imgur.com/9Bzdxh7.png"
  "description": "We implemented the algorithm based on the paper by the same name that addresses the problem of obtaining a quality photograph of a painting by multi-image fusion methods. We took multiple bursts of an image and through and image processing toolchain described in the paper, derived a digital copy of the image. This image fusion method is applicable to photographs of a painting taken with a hand-held camera without any particular setup. It works under bad lighting conditions and eliminates motion blur, even when the painting is protected by a glass screen creating structured reflections of the room."

  "description": "Using edge and color features to get brushstrokes, we extracted geometry features of these brushstrokes like length of major and minor axes (assuming a brushstroke to be an ellipse), the stroke direction, longetivity, size, area, neighboring brushstroke information, we built feature vectors using Van Gogh's work and then differentiated a fake painting from the original, with decent amount of accuracy using binary classifiers (like Naive Bayes and SVM)."

  "image": "http://i.imgur.com/5Eapu3H.jpg?1"
  "description": "A scalable framework for computing realistic illumination based on the research paper 'Lightcuts' [SIGGRAPH 2005]. Our implementation significantly lowered the rendering time for several (>1000) uniformly distributed point light sources. We made use of PBRT as a basic rendering library and made modifications to it to implement the algorithm."

  "description": "Modeled, textured and animated (via forward kinematics) a transformer robot from scratch with OpenGL. Developed an interactive environment for the keyboard controlled bot with inter-object collisions. Used motion captured data in the form of BVH inputs to animate the transformer (via reverse kinematics)."
