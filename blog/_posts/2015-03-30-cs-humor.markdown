A friend of mine claimed to be an *expert in computers*. Further, he asked me to throw any Computer Science term at him, and he'd tell me its meaning in a jiffy.    
I’m going to illustrate a few of the answers that I got from him.

* Argument: The thing that two people get in when they disagree
* Function: A procedure to do something; alternatively a party
* Environment: Surrounding
* String: A material consisting of threads of some material twisted together
* Thread: a long, thin strand of cotton, nylon, or other fibres used in sewing or weaving.
* Statement: Something you say

At this point, I received a call from a batchmate, who was stuck on an assignment. I guess when you say, “Dude! Check if the parent is killing the child correctly” over the phone, it’s bound to raise some eyebrows.

* Constant Variable: An oxymoron?
* Bug: A creature that is small and crawls
* Runtime: Time when you should go for running?
* Heap: A random *stack* of objects
* Python: Obviously a kind of snake
* RTFM: Kamasutra
